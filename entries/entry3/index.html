        <div class="paragraphjp1">こっちのけんとは、1996年生まれの大阪府出身。大学進学を機に上京し、学生時代にはアカペラグループ『ケミカルテット』で全国大会2年連続優勝した経験を持つ。卒業後は就職し、社会人として働きながら本格的に音楽活動をスタートさせた。「真面目にふざける」をモットーに活動し、数々の楽曲がSNSで話題を呼んでいる注目のアーティストだ。3人兄弟の次男で、兄は俳優の菅田将暉、弟には俳優デビューを果たした菅生新樹がいる。
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphjp2">作詞と作曲も手がけるこっちのけんと。作詞を始めたのは、兄・菅田将暉へ贈ったバースデーソングがきっかけだったと明かした。「作詞を始める前、オリジナルでアカペラソングを作ったらどうなるんだろうと思ったんです。ゴスペラーズみたいなことをしたいなと思っていたんですけど、やってみると作詞が難しすぎて……。そこで、最初は兄に向けた誕生日プレゼントとして曲を作ろうと、お手紙みたいな感じで作詞をしたのがきっかけでしたね。自分が思っている感情を文字にするのは難しいんですけど、お手紙を書く感覚だとすんなりできたんです」（こっちのけんと）
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphjp3">SNSで大きな反響があった曲『死ぬな!』はインパクトのあるタイトルがつけられているが、どのような思いが込められているのか尋ねてみた。「辛いとき、冗談でも『死んでしまいたい』と思ったことが皆さんにもあると思うんですけど、そんなときに力づくでも止めたいなと。冗談でも良くないよという気持ちで、現世側というかこっち側へ引っ張ろうという思いで作りました」僕は”良くない事”だと考えているのですが、 『死にたい』と口にする人が多いと感じます。冗談でも言っては いけない事だとも思います。それでも死にたいと考えてしまう人 へ強引に『死ぬな!』と伝えたくて、この曲を作りました。 簡単な言葉にしますが、僕も過去に『死にたい』と考えていまし た。 でも自分を殺す強さもないので、偶然事故にあえるために努力を していたこともあります。今考えるとゾッとします。 そんな人たちに『この先、生きていたら良い事が待ってる』 なんて確証のない言葉で生きる理由を作るよりも、強引に現 世に引っ張る方が助けられるのではないかと思い『死ぬ な!』というタイトルにしました。 この曲を聴いてどうこう変わる事は無いかも知れませんが、 少しでも自分の中の『死にたい自分』と対話してくだされば 幸いです。 まずは『死にたい』と言うよりも、『願い事を3つ』考えてほしいです。 （こっちのけんと）    
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="paragraphjp5">曲のフックは、アーティストたちの旅の継続性を再度強調しています。世界とその複雑さが絶えず変化していることを強調し、現在の瞬間の歴史的な意義を指摘しています。「全て飲み込む Black Hole」という繰り返しは、「すべてを飲み込むBlack Hole」と訳され、直面する課題の圧倒的で全消費的な性質を強調し、アーティストたちがこれらの障害に立ち向かい、乗り越える能力を示しています。全体として、「Black Hole」は、釈迦坊主(Shaka Bose)をフィーチャーしたKaine dot Co、Sleet Mage、Tohjiによる曲で、個人的な経験に深く入り込み、「Black Hole」という形で表現される強力で全消費的な力の概念を探求しています。鮮やかなイメージを通じて、アーティストたちの苦闘、誘惑、絶え間ない旅を捉え、人生の変化し続ける性質と、内なる闇に立ち向かうために必要な強さを聴衆に思い起こさせます。

        <div class="paragraphen1">Kento Kocchi, born in 1996 in Osaka, moved to Tokyo for university and during his student years, he experienced consecutive victories at the national competition as part of the a cappella group "Chemical Quartet." After graduating and entering the workforce, he officially started his music career. Operating under the motto "seriously fooling around," he has gained attention as an emerging artist with several of his songs becoming popular on social media. He is the second of three siblings, with his elder brother being the actor Masaki Suda and his younger brother, Shinki Suga, having made his debut as an actor.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphen2">Kento Kocchi is involved in both lyric writing and composing. He revealed that he started writing lyrics after creating a birthday song for his brother, Masaki Suda. "Before I started writing lyrics, I wondered what would happen if I created an original a cappella song. I wanted to do something like the Gospellers, but writing lyrics turned out to be too difficult... So, initially, I decided to create a song as a birthday present for my brother. It was like writing a letter, and that's how I got into lyric writing. It's difficult to express the emotions I have in words, but it was easier when I approached it like writing a letter," said Kento Kocchi.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphen3">The song "Shinu na! (Don't Die!)" gained significant traction on social media, and it has an impactful title. When asked about the thoughts behind it, Kocchi explained, "During tough times, everyone might have had thoughts like 'I wish I were dead,' even if it's just a joke. At such times, I wanted to forcefully stop those thoughts. It's a feeling of saying it's not good, even if it's a joke, and wanting to pull them towards the side of the living, towards this world." Kocchi expressed concern about the commonality of people saying "I want to die," even in jest. While acknowledging that it's not something to joke about, he emphasized the importance of delivering a forceful message of "Don't die!" to those who might entertain such thoughts. He shared that he, too, had considered the idea of wanting to die in the past. Reflecting on his past thoughts, he found it chilling. He created the song with the title "Don't Die!" believing that forcefully pulling someone towards the present world might be more helpful than creating reasons to live based on uncertain words like "good things are waiting for you in the future." He concluded by expressing the hope that, while listening to the song might not change everything, if it encourages even a bit of dialogue with the "I want to die" aspect within oneself, he would be grateful. He encouraged people to think of "three wishes" before saying "I want to die."
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="paragraphen5">The hooks in the song further reiterate the ongoing nature of the artists' journey. They emphasize the idea that the world and its complexities are constantly changing, noting the historical significance of the present moment. The repetition of "全て飲み込む Black Hole" (translated as "Black Hole that engulfs everything"), reinforces the overwhelming and all-consuming nature of the challenges faced, highlighting the artists' ability to confront and navigate through these obstacles.
          Overall, "Black Hole" by 釈迦坊主 (Shaka Bose) featuring Kaine dot Co, Sleet Mage, and Tohji is a song that delves deep into personal experiences and explores the concept of a powerful and all-consuming force in the form of a "Black Hole." Through vivid imagery, it captures the struggles, temptations, and ongoing journeys of the artists, reminding listeners of the ever-changing nature of life and the resilience needed to face the darkness within.
