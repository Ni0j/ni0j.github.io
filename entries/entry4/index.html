        <div class="paragraphjp1">Reol:2018年10月にフルアルバム『事実上』を発売した後、リリースする作品はミニアルバムなのか、EPなのかを考えた時に、自分の中でミニアルバムはコンセプチュアルに完結するイメージだったんです。EPというのはアルバムに向かっていくもので、EPから2、3曲次のアルバムに収録するという方が多いと思うんですけど、今回『金字塔』に『文明EP』の曲が入っていないのは、これまでEPを作って次にアルバムを作る続き物を作ったことがなかったので、やってみたいなと思ったからです。「EPは3曲入りでも4曲入りでもいいな」ということで、自分の中でその数に因みたいと思ったんですね。次元(3次元、4次元)とか文明(三大文明、四大文明)とか。その当時、一番興味を惹かれていたのが文明だったので、自分なりに一つの文明の起こりから繁栄、衰退していく流れを4曲で表したくて。本当はEPらしく2曲ほど次のアルバムに持っていくつもりで作っていたんですけど、『文明EP』という作品であって、そこからアルバムに持っていくのは違うかもなとも思って。文明の後にはみんな塔を建てるんですよね。
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphjp2">Reol:『文明EP』の時からずっと変わらずに考えてることがあって。偉くなった人って何かを作るんですよ。ピラミッドや古墳なんかもそうだし、ビルなどが例になるかと思うんですが、そういった高さや大きさのある建築物を作りたがる。フルアルバムを出すのに生半可なものは出したくなかったので制作期間をある程度とって、その間に開催したライブツアー『文明ココロミー』と『侵攻アップグレード』は経由地として、全ては『金字塔』に至るまでの布石でした。「金字塔」は孟子の気持ちになって書いたんですよ。だから、人称が〈汝〉とか〈君子〉なんですけど、あの時代の皇帝だったら、私が頑張らなければならないという気持ちをもっと言葉尻強く言うんじゃないかなと思って、それが強調されて〈見下したい〉といった歌詞が使われています。
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="paragraphjp5">曲のフックは、アーティストたちの旅の継続性を再度強調しています。世界とその複雑さが絶えず変化していることを強調し、現在の瞬間の歴史的な意義を指摘しています。「全て飲み込む Black Hole」という繰り返しは、「すべてを飲み込むBlack Hole」と訳され、直面する課題の圧倒的で全消費的な性質を強調し、アーティストたちがこれらの障害に立ち向かい、乗り越える能力を示しています。全体として、「Black Hole」は、釈迦坊主(Shaka Bose)をフィーチャーしたKaine dot Co、Sleet Mage、Tohjiによる曲で、個人的な経験に深く入り込み、「Black Hole」という形で表現される強力で全消費的な力の概念を探求しています。鮮やかなイメージを通じて、アーティストたちの苦闘、誘惑、絶え間ない旅を捉え、人生の変化し続ける性質と、内なる闇に立ち向かうために必要な強さを聴衆に思い起こさせます。

        <div class="paragraphen1">Reol: After releasing the full album "Jijitsujo" in October 2018, when I considered whether the next release would be a mini-album or an EP, I personally envisioned a mini-album as something conceptually complete. EPs typically lead towards an album, with many artists including 2 or 3 songs from the EP in the next album. The reason why the songs from "Bunmei EP" are not included in "Kinjitou" is that I had never created a sequel to an EP leading to the next album before, and I wanted to try doing that. I thought, "It's okay for an EP to have 3 or 4 songs," and I wanted the number to reflect something meaningful, like dimensions (3D, 4D) or civilizations (Three Great Civilizations, Four Great Civilizations). At that time, I was most intrigued by civilizations, so I wanted to depict the rise, prosperity, and decline of a civilization in four songs. Originally, I had planned to create two songs in the EP style to carry over to the next album, but as a work called "Bunmei EP," I felt it might be different to bring them into the album. After a civilization, everyone builds a tower.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphen2">Reol: Since the time of "Bunmei EP," there's something I've consistently thought about. Successful people create something. It could be pyramids, ancient burial mounds, or modern buildings. They tend to want to build tall and large structures. I didn't want to release something half-hearted for a full album, so I took a considerable production period. The live tours, "Bunmei Kokoromi" and "Shinko Appugureedo," held during that time were stepping stones to everything leading up to "Kinjitou." I wrote "Kinjitou" from the perspective of Mencius. Therefore, the pronouns used are "thou" or "gentleman." If I were an emperor of that era, I think there would be a stronger emphasis on saying that I must work hard, and that is reflected in the lyrics expressing a desire to "look down."

        <!-- <div class="paragraphen3">The song "Shinu na! (Don't Die!)" gained significant traction on social media, and it has an impactful title. When asked about the thoughts behind it, Kocchi explained, "During tough times, everyone might have had thoughts like 'I wish I were dead,' even if it's just a joke. At such times, I wanted to forcefully stop those thoughts. It's a feeling of saying it's not good, even if it's a joke, and wanting to pull them towards the side of the living, towards this world." Kocchi expressed concern about the commonality of people saying "I want to die," even in jest. While acknowledging that it's not something to joke about, he emphasized the importance of delivering a forceful message of "Don't die!" to those who might entertain such thoughts. He shared that he, too, had considered the idea of wanting to die in the past. Reflecting on his past thoughts, he found it chilling. He created the song with the title "Don't Die!" believing that forcefully pulling someone towards the present world might be more helpful than creating reasons to live based on uncertain words like "good things are waiting for you in the future." He concluded by expressing the hope that, while listening to the song might not change everything, if it encourages even a bit of dialogue with the "I want to die" aspect within oneself, he would be grateful. He encouraged people to think of "three wishes" before saying "I want to die."
        </div> -->
        <!-- <div class="paragraphen5">The hooks in the song further reiterate the ongoing nature of the artists' journey. They emphasize the idea that the world and its complexities are constantly changing, noting the historical significance of the present moment. The repetition of "全て飲み込む Black Hole" (translated as "Black Hole that engulfs everything"), reinforces the overwhelming and all-consuming nature of the challenges faced, highlighting the artists' ability to confront and navigate through these obstacles.
          Overall, "Black Hole" by 釈迦坊主 (Shaka Bose) featuring Kaine dot Co, Sleet Mage, and Tohji is a song that delves deep into personal experiences and explores the concept of a powerful and all-consuming force in the form of a "Black Hole." Through vivid imagery, it captures the struggles, temptations, and ongoing journeys of the artists, reminding listeners of the ever-changing nature of life and the resilience needed to face the darkness within.
